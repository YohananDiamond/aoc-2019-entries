# Advent of Code 2019 entries

So, here's my entries on the [Advent of Code: 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)!

I've decided now that I'll do these challenges in multiple languages, as I've set another challenge for myself that involves trying out multiple languages.\
And yeah, it's already 2020, I'm late... but no problem, this seems interesting!

## Progress

```
Day01 -> Part1 => Done!
         Part2 => Done!
Day02 -> Part1 => Done!
         Part2 => Gave up;
```
